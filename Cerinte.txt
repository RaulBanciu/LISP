1a) Write a function to return the n-th element of a list, or NIL if such an element does not exist.
b) Write a function to check whether an atom E is a member of a list which is not necessarily linear.
c) Write a function to determine the list of all sublists of a given list, on any level.
 A sublist is either the list itself, or any element that is a list, at any level. Example:
 (1 2 (3 (4 5) (6 7)) 8 (9 10)) => 5 sublists :
 ( (1 2 (3 (4 5) (6 7)) 8 (9 10)) (3 (4 5) (6 7)) (4 5) (6 7) (9 10) )
d) Write a function to transform a linear list into a set
2)Determine the list of nodes accesed in postorder in a tree of type (A 2 B 0 C 2 D 0 E 0).
(A has 2 children		A
B has 0 children	       / \
C has 2 children	      B	  C
D has 0 children		 / \
E has 0 children)		D   E
3)Write a function that removes all occurrences of an atom from any level of a list.
